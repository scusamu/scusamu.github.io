    <h1>St Kilda Club History</h1> 
    
    St Kilda Football Club, nicknamed the Saints, is an Australian rules football club based in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The club plays in the Australian Football League, the sport's premier league.
The club's name originates from the bayside Melbourne suburb of St Kilda in which the club was established in 1873.
St Kilda were a foundation team of the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1877 and later, in 1897, became a foundation team in the Victorian Football League (VFL), which was renamed the Australian Football League (AFL) prior to the start of the 1990 season.
St Kilda have only won a single premiership to date, a famous one-point win in the 1966 VFL Grand Final. St Kilda most recently won the minor premiership in the 2009 AFL season and were grand finalists in 2009 and 2010.
St Kilda developed a reputation as perennial underachievers, much of this attributed to their record of finishing last more often than any other club in the league (27 times)  as well as having the third lowest all-time win percentage of any team still playing in the league.
